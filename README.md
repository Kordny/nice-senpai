nice bot

this is a super cool special awesome very nice bot no bully running on a undisclosed location somewhere

(its a very nice place no bully allowed)

if you would like to halp that would be berry nice of yuo!

first of all you need this thing to run it: https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

which also means u need python 3.5 to run it

anyway to test things you'll need a discord bot found over here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me

then you make a new bot and you get the token and save it as a file called token. (no newline at the end btw)

and then uhhh you can invite your bot to a server through some dumb bullshit way i dunno l0l google it

and then you run the bot dude cmon?
