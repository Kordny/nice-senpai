# Nice-Senpai
nice bot
does dabs and stuff...
fork with added twitter and live stream updates
removed commands that need admin permissions

## Installation
>For running it and or testing / developing
### Requirements:
- node.js

### How to:
1. Install node.js (Current if you're cool, LTS if you're square)
1. Clone the repo. Either `git clone` if you're a smart kid or just download the zip.
1. `npm install` should get all the dependacies from `package.json`.
1. Put your bot token in the token field in `config.json`.
   1. To get a bot go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
   1. Make a new bot ( or make use of an existing one )
   1. Reveal the token and copy paste it
1. Get the bot in your server.
   1. Copy the id marked client id *not the token* into the client id field here: https://discordapi.com/permissions.html and then follow the link that it generates.
   1. You don't need to bother ticking perms just invite it to your server ( You have to have a certain level of permissions to invite it to a server, you can't invite it willy nilly even if you can make regular invite links )
1. It's super helpful to go in your discord settings -> appearance and enable developer mode so you can right click people channels and servers to copy ids.
1. Copy your profile id and put it in the owner id field in `config.json`.
1. At this point the bot should be workable, either run it with `node senpai.js`. Or if you're a cool kid ðŸ˜Ž press F5 on VS Code and it knows to run `senpai.js` based on the `package.json` file.
1. Make sure to have fun, I mean it. I'm like santa, I'll know if you're not having fun. And I'd come for you then.

1. *Dubs, nice*
